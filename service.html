                            <li>✅ Impact on Credit Score: A write-off is reported to credit bureaus as a derogatory

                            <li>✅ Collections: Even after a write-off, the lender may sell the debt to a collection
                                agency, which can continue pursuing the borrower for repayment.</li>

                            A Loan Enquiry is the process of seeking information about available loans from financial
                            institutions, such as banks or non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). It involves asking
                            about loan types, interest rates, repayment terms, eligibility criteria, and other
                            conditions before applying for a loan. The enquiry helps individuals or businesses evaluate
                            different loan options and determine which one best suits their needs and financial
                            situation. It can be done through online platforms, by visiting a bank, or contacting
                            customer support.

                            CMR (Credit Monitoring Report) and Balance Sheet are two important financial tools used in
                            assessing the financial health of an organization. Here's a brief description of both:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✅ Purpose: CMR is a report used by banks and financial institutions to assess the
                                creditworthiness of an individual or business. It is generated by credit bureaus like
                                CIBIL (Credit Information Bureau India Limited).</li>
                            <li>✅ Purpose: A balance sheet is a financial statement that shows a company’s financial
                                position at a specific point in time. It lists the company’s assets, liabilities, and
                                equity.</li>
                            <li>✅ Content: The report includes detailed information on an entity’s credit history,
                                including loans, credit cards, repayment patterns, defaults, and outstanding debt.</li>
